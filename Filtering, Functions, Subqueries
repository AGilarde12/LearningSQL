------------------------------------------------WHERE-------------------------------------------

The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified criterion.

The syntax for the WHERE clause:
```SQL
SELECT column_list 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

Drag and drop from the options below to select the name of the student whose id is equal to 23.
```SQL
SELECT id,name
FROM students
WHERE id = 23
```


-----------------------------------------------BETWEEN----------------------------------------
The BETWEEN operator selects values within a range. The first value must be lower bound and the second value, the upper bound.

The syntax for the BETWEEN clause is as follows:
```SQL
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
```

The following SQL statement selects all records with IDs that fall between 3 and 7:
```SQL
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE ID BETWEEN 3 AND 7;
```

---------------------------------------------AND OR ETC---------------------------------------
Logical Operators

Logical operators can be used to combine two Boolean values and return a result of true, false, or null.
The following operators can be used:

```SQL
AND -- True if both expressions are true
OR -- True if either expression is true
IN -- True if an operand is equal to one of a list of expressions
NOT -- Returns True if an expression is not true

```SQL
SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName, Age
FROM customers
WHERE Age >= 30 AND Age <= 40;
```
AND OR
The statement below selects all customers from the city "New York" AND with the age equal to "30" OR â€œ35":

```SQL
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE City = 'New York'
AND (Age=30 OR Age=35);
```

Drag and drop from the options below to select customers whose ids are either 1 or 2, and whose city is ''Boston''.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE (id = 1 OR id = 2)
AND city = 'Boston'
```

----------------------------------------------IN NOT IN-------------------------------------------
The in operator lets you make your query more clean

```SQL
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE City IN ('New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago');
```

The NOT IN operator allows you to exclude a list of specific values from the result set.

If we add the NOT keyword before IN in our previous query, customers living in those cities will be excluded:
```SQL
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE City NOT IN ('New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago');
```
