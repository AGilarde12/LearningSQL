First lets get the first ten rows by salary in desc:

```sql
SELECT
  last_name, job_title, salary
ORDER BY
  salary DESC
FETCH FIRST
  10 ROWS ONLY
```

Then lets order by count:
```sql
SELECT
  company_division, count(*)
FROM
  staff_div_reg_country
GROUP BY
  company_divison
ORDER BY
  count(*) DESC
FETCH FIRST
  5 ROWS ONLY
