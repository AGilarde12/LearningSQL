Let's continue our look at ways to group and aggregate data with two other operators, ROLLUPs and CUBEs. Now first, let's modify the staff division region view we created to include country code.

We do this buy creating or replacing the current view:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW staff_div_reg_country AS
	SELECT
		s.*, cd.company_division, cr.company_regions, cr.country
	FROM
		staff s
	LEFT JOIN
		company_divisions cd
	ON
		s.department = cd.department
	LEFT JOIN
		company_regions cr
	ON
		s.region_id = cr.region_id
```

Now lets select the number of employees by company, region and country:

```sql
SELECT
	company_regions, country, count(*)
FROM
	staff_div_reg_country
	/*we use rollup to sum the hierarchy for regions and countries*/
GROUP BY
	ROLLUP(company_regions, country)
ORDER BY
	country, company_regions
```

Now lets use a cube:
```sql
SELECT
	company_division, company_regions, count(*)
FROM
	staff_div_reg_country
GROUP BY
	CUBE(company_division, company_regions)
	/*Cube tells SQL to create all possible combinations of sets of grouping columns*/
	/*For example, for each division, show results by region.*/
```
