Newer versions of SQL provide additional features for operating on rows related to the currently processed row. For example, if you want to know a person's salary and the next lower salary in the department, we could use the lag function.

```sql
SELECT
  department,
  last_name,
  salary,
  lag(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY DEPARTMENT ORDER BY SALARY DESC)
FROM
  staff
/*LAG refers to the row that came before the processed row*/
```

Lead does the opposite of lag and takes the row ahead

```sql
SELECT
  department,
  last_name,
  salary,
  lead(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
FROM
  staff
```
