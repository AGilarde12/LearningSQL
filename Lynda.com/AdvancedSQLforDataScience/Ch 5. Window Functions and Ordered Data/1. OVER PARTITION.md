Instead of using a subquery to calculate an average salary for an employee's department, we can use a windowing function on rows called OVER PARTITION. Let's take a look at an example. Let's select department, last_name, and salary.

```sql
SELECT
  department,
  last_name,
  salary,
  avg(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department)
FROM
  staff
```

Output:

| department   | last name  | salary | avg                  |
|--------------|------------|--------|----------------------|
