# Chapter 2

## Mock database
In this chapter we are creating a mock_staff database using the mock_staff.sql script seen in this repository.

We use PostgreSQL to construct and manage the database with pgAdmin as our GUI tool. The three tables we will be working with are:
  * company_divisons
  * company_regions
  * staff
